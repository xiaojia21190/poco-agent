## Positioning

Poco turns Claude Code into a cloud-native, autonomous coworker. Built on cloud-based Claude Code, it delivers a Manus-like autonomous experience while keeping humans in the loop, and it plugs into the MCP/Skills ecosystem for rich extensibility.

## Why Poco

- **Full Claude Code experience**: everything Claude Code can do, not just coding
- **General-purpose agents via Skills/MCP**: connect tools and data to handle docs, organization, and analysis
- **Cloud execution with human control**: queue tasks in parallel, confirm before key actions

## What you can do

- Give a goal, get an executable plan with live progress
- Let agents read, write, and organize real files safely
- Run multiple tasks in parallel across desktop and mobile

## Ecosystem

Poco embraces the **MCP/Skills** ecosystem so you can connect tools, data sources, and workflows as building blocks. Bring your own MCP servers or Skills to extend what agents can do without reinventing the platform.
